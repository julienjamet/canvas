I am getting an error I can't solve with the online version of this projet : 

My localStorage.setItem() and localStorage.getItem() functions are blocked and the console tells me :
"Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'."

Nevertheless you can perfectly use the site locally by downloading or cloning the repository.
